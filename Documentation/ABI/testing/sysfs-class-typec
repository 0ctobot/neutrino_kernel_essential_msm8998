What:		/sys/class/typec/<port>/current_data_role
Date:		June 2016
Contact:	Heikki Krogerus <heikki.krogerus@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		The current USB data role the port is operating in. This
		attribute can be used for requesting data role swapping on the
		port. Swapping is supported as synchronous operation, so
		write(2) to the attribute will not return until the operation
		has finished. The attribute is notified about role changes so
		that poll(2) on the attribute wakes up.

		Valid values:
		- host
		- device

What:		/sys/class/typec/<port>/current_power_role
Date:		June 2016
Contact:	Heikki Krogerus <heikki.krogerus@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		The current power role of the port. This attribute can be used
		to request power role swap on the port when the port supports
		USB Power Delivery. Swapping is supported as synchronous
		operation, so write(2) to the attribute will not return until
		the operation has finished. The attribute is notified about role
		changes so that poll(2) on the attribute wakes up.

		Valid values:
		- source

What:		/sys/class/typec/<port>/vconn_source
Date:		June 2016
Contact:	Heikki Krogerus <heikki.krogerus@linux.intel.com>

		when both the port and the partner support USB Power Delivery.
		Swapping is supported as synchronous operation, so write(2) to
		the attribute will not return until the operation has finished.
		The attribute is notified about VCONN source changes so that
		poll(2) on the attribute wakes up.

		Valid values are:
		- 0 when the port is not the VCONN Source
		- 1 when the port is the VCONN Source

USB Type-C cable devices (eg. /sys/class/typec/usbc0-cable/)

Note: Electronically Marked Cables will have a device also for one cable plug
(eg. /sys/class/typec/usbc0-plug0). If the cable is active and has also SOP
Double Prime controller (USB Power Deliver specification ch. 2.4) it will have
second device also for the other plug. Both plugs may have their alternate modes
as described in USB Type-C and USB Power Delivery specifications.

Alternate Mode devices (For example,
/sys/class/typec/usbc0-partner/usbc0-partner.svid:xxxx/). The ports, partners
and cable plugs can have alternate modes.

What:		/sys/class/typec/<dev>/<dev>.svid:<svid>/<mode>/active
Date:		June 2016
Contact:	Heikki Krogerus <heikki.krogerus@linux.intel.com>

		Shows if the mode is active or not. The attribute can be used
		for entering/exiting the mode with partners and cable plugs, and
		with the port alternate modes it can be used for disabling
		support for specific alternate modes. Entering/exiting modes is
		supported as synchronous operation so write(2) to the attribute
		does not return until the enter/exit mode operation has
		finished. The attribute is notified when the mode is
		entered/exited so poll(2) on the attribute wakes up.

		Valid values:
		- 0 when the mode is deactive
		- 1 when the mode is active
